## Getting Started

The Selenium to Playwright Converter Enterprise Edition is a web-based application that provides a comprehensive solution for migrating your Selenium test automation to Playwright.

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection

### Accessing the Application

Access the application at: https://qrabuhhk.manus.space

## Uploading Files

The application supports multiple ways to upload your Selenium test files:

### Individual File Upload

1. Click on the main upload area or the "Select Files" button
2. Choose one or more Java files containing Selenium tests
3. The files will be uploaded and prepared for conversion

### Folder Upload

1. Click the "Select Folder" button
2. Choose a folder containing your Selenium test suite
3. The application will maintain your folder structure during conversion

### ZIP Archive Upload

1. Drag and drop a ZIP file containing your Selenium test suite onto the upload area
2. The application will extract the ZIP file and maintain your project structure

### Large File Support

- The application supports files up to 1000MB in size
- Large files are uploaded in chunks for better reliability
- Progress indicators show upload status for each file

## Converting Individual Files

For single file conversion:

1. Upload a Java file containing Selenium tests
2. The file will appear in the file tree on the left sidebar
3. Click on the file to select it
4. The conversion will start automatically
5. View the original Java code and converted TypeScript code side by side
6. Review any conversion notes or warnings
7. Download the converted file using the download button

## Converting Test Suites

For converting entire test suites:

1. Upload a folder or ZIP file containing your Selenium test suite
2. The application will analyze the project structure
3. Navigate to the "Conversion" tab
4. Review the file structure in the sidebar
5. Click "Convert All" to start batch conversion
6. Monitor progress in the conversion tab
7. Once complete, download the entire converted project as a ZIP file

### Project Structure Analysis

The application automatically:

- Identifies test classes, page objects, and utility classes
- Maps dependencies between files
- Preserves your package structure
- Handles Gradle project configurations

## Using Conversion Templates

Conversion templates allow you to save and reuse conversion settings:

1. Navigate to the "Templates" tab
2. Select an existing template or create a new one
3. Configure template settings:
   - Maintain project structure
   - Generate configuration files
   - Add explanatory comments
   - Convert page objects
   - Convert utility classes
4. Save your template
5. Apply the template to future conversions

### Default Templates

- **Default Template**: Standard conversion settings
- **Minimal Conversion**: Converts only test files with minimal configuration

## Managing Batch Jobs

For large projects, the batch job queue helps manage multiple conversion tasks:

1. Navigate to the "Job Queue" tab
2. View all queued, processing, completed, and failed jobs
3. Monitor progress for each job
4. Retry failed jobs
5. Cancel running jobs if needed
6. View detailed job statistics

### Job Priority

Jobs are processed in the order they are submitted. The status indicators show:

- **Queued**: Waiting to be processed
- **Processing**: Currently being converted
- **Completed**: Successfully converted
- **Failed**: Encountered errors during conversion

## Analyzing Conversion Metrics

The Analytics tab provides insights into your conversion activities:

1. Navigate to the "Analytics" tab
2. View key metrics:
   - Total conversions
   - Files converted
   - Success rate
   - Average conversion time
3. Analyze conversion trends over time
4. Identify common conversion issues
5. Review file type distribution

### Using Analytics for Optimization

- Identify patterns in failed conversions
- Understand which Selenium patterns cause the most issues
- Track improvements in conversion success rates over time

## Saving and Loading Projects

To save your work and return to it later:

1. Navigate to the "Projects" tab
2. Click "Save Current Project"
3. Enter a name and description
4. Click "Save Project"

To load a saved project:

1. Navigate to the "Projects" tab
2. Find your project in the list
3. Click the "Load" button
4. All files and conversion settings will be restored

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Upload Problems

- **File too large**: Ensure files are under 1000MB
- **Upload fails**: Try uploading in smaller batches
- **ZIP extraction fails**: Ensure the ZIP file is not corrupted

#### Conversion Issues

- **Unsupported Selenium features**: Some advanced Selenium features may require manual adjustment
- **Custom frameworks**: Custom test frameworks may need additional configuration
- **Complex XPath selectors**: Very complex XPath selectors might need manual review

### Error Messages

- Review error messages in the conversion tab
- Check the file progress indicators for specific file errors
- Use the comments in the converted code to identify issues

## Best Practices

### Preparing Your Selenium Tests

- Use standard Selenium patterns for best conversion results
- Avoid highly customized frameworks when possible
- Keep XPath selectors simple and maintainable

### Conversion Workflow

1. Start with a small sample of tests to validate conversion quality
2. Use templates to standardize conversion settings
3. Convert related files together to maintain dependencies
4. Review and test converted scripts before implementing

### After Conversion

- Review all conversion notes and warnings
- Test the converted scripts in your Playwright environment
- Make any necessary manual adjustments
- Update your CI/CD pipeline to use Playwright
